# RadiantAI
 Recreating the RadiantAI system from Oblivion

 Goals of this project:

 1: NPC Schedule System

    • This is the main brunt work of the project. The idea is to create a very versatile
    system to allow for schedules to be created. This includes tools for laying out the schedules,
    allowing for distractions to the schedule, and making it in depth enough that an action can effect the 
    schedules of others (The local weapon shop owner dies, and until someone takes over people have to travel
    elsewhere to get their weapons.)
    • Daily Schedules
    • Schedules repeated weekly
    • Ability to be distracted mid task, then return to task
    • Tasks
         - Types:
         - Idle
         - Chat
         - Wander
         - Patrol
         - Travel
         - Retrieve/Return
         - Eat
         - Sleep
         - More?
    • Task priority : Can another task override this one? Is it so integral to the NPC that they will
    forgo completing another task until this one is complete, unless that new task is of higher priority?

 2: Entity Attribute System

    • The purpose of this system is to incorporate different skills and
    abilities into the NPC's tasks, as well as tracking various stats.
    For example, the responsibility stat, which determines a characters
    willingness to break laws in order to achieve a task. i.e. steal from someone
    to get food, kill another NPC, etc.

 3: Dialogue System

    • This is both to allow the NPC's to chat with each other, but also to allow a player
    avatar to interact with NPCs.



All-in-all, I want to best recreate the Oblivion Radiant AI system, with some tweaks of my own, in order to create what feels like
a truly living, breathing world.
